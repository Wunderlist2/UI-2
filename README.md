The index.html and contact_us.html uses basic html tags for layout of the header and navigation.  The introduction of css grid was used to style the navigation and layout team members profiles on the about_us.html.

Mixins were used to create text effects for :hover and used to highlight the current page you are reading.  Variables were set up for the color palette used by our UX Designer to keep everything the same.  A parametric mixin was used to create the button effects.

the reset.less file uses the basic reset from meyerweb.com
